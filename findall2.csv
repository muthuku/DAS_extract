This work thus contributes to the expansion of usable E3 ligases for potential drug development.', 'Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has risen as a promising therapeutic modality. Leveraging the catalytic nature of the ubiquitinâ€“proteasome enzymatic machinery, TPD exhibits higher potency to eliminate disease-causing target proteins such as oncogenic transcription factors that may otherwise be difficult to abrogate by conventional inhibitors. However, there are challenges that remain. Currently, nearly all degraders engage CUL4', ' or CUL2', ' as the E3 ligase for target ubiquitination. While their immediate efficacies are evident, the narrowed E3 ligase options make TPD vulnerable to potential drug resistance. In addition, E3 ligases show differential tissue expression and have intrinsic limitations in accessing varying types of disease-relevant targets. As the success of TPD is closely associated with the ability of E3 ligases to efficiently polyubiquitinate the target of interest, the long-term outlook of TPD drug development will depend on whether E3 ligases such as CUL4', ' and CUL2', ' are accessible to the targets of interest. To overcome these potential caveats, a broad collection of actionable E3 ligases is required.

Twenty-one subjects underwent non-invasive pulmonary diagnostic testing, including maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) and impulse oscillometry (IOS). In addition, five soldiers received a lung biopsy; tissue results were compared to a previously published sample from a soldier in our Iraq Afghanistan War Lung Injury database and others in our database with similar exposures, including burn pits.

Lung tissue, when available, was examined for carbonaceous particles, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Raman spectroscopy), metals, titanium connected to iron (Brookhaven National Laboratory, National Synchrotron Light Source II, Beamline 5-ID), oxidized metals, combustion temperature, inflammatory cell accumulation and fibrosis, neutrophil extracellular traps, Sirius red, Prussian Blue, as well as polarizable crystals/particulate matter/dust. Among twenty-one previously healthy, deployable soldiers with non-invasive pulmonary diagnostic tests, post-deployment, all had severely decreased MEP values, averaging 42% predicted.

These tests support the concept of airways hyperresponsiveness and distal airways narrowing, respectively. Among the five soldiers biopsied, all had constrictive bronchiolitis or bronchiolitis or severe pulmonary fibrosis. We detected the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)â€”which are products of incomplete combustionâ€”in the lung tissue of all five warfighters. All also had detectable titanium and iron in the lungs. Metals were all oxidized, supporting the concept of inhaling burned metals. Combustion temperature was consistent with that of burned petrol rather than higher temperatures noted with cigarettes. All were nonsmokers. Neutrophil extracellular traps were reported in two biopsies. Compared to our prior biopsies in our Middle East deployment database, these histopathologic results are similar, since all database biopsies have constrictive bronchiolitis, one has lung fibrosis with titanium bound to iron in fixed mathematical ratios of 1:7 and demonstrated polarizable crystals. These results, particularly constrictive bronchiolitis and polarizable crystals, support the prior data of King et al. (N. Engl. J.

First, we optimized image preprocessing to increase the algorithmâ€™s sensitivity to mismatches in registered images. Second, we developed an attention-gated simulated annealing procedure capable of focusing on the differences between perinatal brains.

We tested CORGI on 28 samples of whole-mounted perinatal mouse brains (P0â€“P9) and compared its accuracy with other registration algorithms.

In its core procedure, the ancestral background of the profiled patient is replaced with one of any number of individuals with known ancestry. The data synthesis framework is applicable to multiple profiling platforms, making it possible to assess the performance of inference specifically for a given molecular profile and separately for each continental-level ancestry; this ability extends to all ancestries, including those without statistically sufficient representation in the existing cancer data. The inference procedure was demonstrated to be accurate and robust in a wide range of sequencing depths. Testing of the approach in four representative cancer types and across three molecular profiling modalities showed that continental-level ancestry of patients can be inferred with high accuracy, as quantified by its agreement with the gold standard of deriving ancestry from matching cancer-free molecular data.

The method exacerbates the single-cell sequencing problem of low yield per cell with uneven expression levels. This accounts for low and uneven sequencing coverage and makes SNV detection and phylogenetic analysis challenging. In this article, we demonstrate for the first time that scRNA-seq data contain sufficient evolutionary signal and can also be utilized in phylogenetic analyses. We explore and compare results of such analyses based on both expression levels and SNVs called from scRNA-seq data. Both techniques are shown to be useful for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships between cells, reflecting the clonal composition of a tumor. Both standardized expression values and SNVs appear to be equally capable of reconstructing a similar pattern of phylogenetic relationship.

Agos bind small RNAs (sRNAs) including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) to form the functional core of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The sRNA is used as a guide to target mRNAs containing either partially or fully complementary sequences, ultimately leading to downregulation of the corresponding proteins. It was previously shown that the kinase CK1Î± phosphorylates a cluster of residues in the eukaryotic insertion (EI) of Ago, leading to the alleviation of miRNA-mediated repression through an undetermined mechanism. We show that binding of miRNA-loaded human Ago2 to target RNA with complementarity to the seed and 3â€™ supplementary regions of the miRNA primes the EI for hierarchical phosphorylation by CK1Î±. The added negative charges electrostatically promote target release, freeing Ago to seek out additional targets once it is dephosphorylated. The high conservation of potential phosphosites in the EI suggests that such a regulatory strategy may be a shared mechanism for regulating miRNA-mediated repression.', 'Proteins are the chemical â€˜workhorsesâ€™ of the cell: some help maintain a cellâ€™s shape or structure, while others carry out the chemical reactions necessary for life. Organisms therefore need to keep tight control over the production of proteins in their cells, so that the right amount of each protein is made at the right time, in the right place.', 'Instructions for making new proteins are encoded in a type of molecule called messenger RNA. Each messenger RNA contains the instructions for one protein, which are then â€˜readâ€™ and carried out by special cellular machinery called ribosomes. The cell can control how much protein it produces by regulating both the levels of different messenger RNA and the amount of protein ribosomes are allowed to make from those instructions.', 'The main way to regulate the levels of messenger RNA is through their transcription from the genome. However, this needs fine tuning. Cells can do this in a highly specific way using molecules called microRNAs. A microRNA works by directing a protein called Argonaute to the messenger RNA that it targets. Once Argonaute arrives, it can call in additional â€˜helper proteinsâ€™ to shut down, or reduce, protein production from that messenger RNA, or alternatively to break down the messenger RNA altogether.', 'Cells can use an enzyme called CK1Î± to attach bulky chemical groups onto a specific part of the Argonaute protein, in a reaction termed phosphorylation. The ability to carry out this reaction (and to reverse it) also seems to be important for microRNAs to do their job properly, but why has remained unknown. Bibel et al. wanted to determine what triggers CK1Î± to phosphorylate Argonaute, and how this affects interactions between microRNAs, Argonaute and their target messenger RNAs.', 'A series of â€˜test tubeâ€™ experiments looked at the interaction between purified CK1Î± and Argonaute under different conditions. These demonstrated that CK1Î± could only carry out its phosphorylation reaction when Argonaute was already interacting with a microRNA and its corresponding messenger RNA. Further measurements revealed that phosphorylation of Argonaute made it detach from the messenger RNA more quickly. This suggests that phosphorylation might be a way to let Argonaute seek out new messenger RNAs after blocking protein production at its first â€˜targetâ€™.', 'These results shed new light on a fundamental mechanism that cells use to control protein production.

As the same disinhibitory cortical circuit is present virtually throughout cortex, we wondered whether VIP neurons are likewise recruited by reinforcers throughout cortex. We monitored VIP neural activity in dozens of cortical regions using three-dimensional random access two-photon microscopy and fiber photometry while mice learned an auditory discrimination task. We found that reward and punishment during initial learning produce rapid, cortex-wide activation of most VIP interneurons. This global recruitment mode showed variations in temporal dynamics in individual neurons and across areas. Neither the weak sensory tuning of VIP interneurons in visual cortex nor their arousal state modulation was fully predictive of reinforcer responses.

Overall, our findings describe the comprehensive transcriptome of cells within the follicle cell tumor model at the single-cell resolution and identify a previously unappreciated link between Keap1-Nrf2 signaling and cell plasticity at early tumorigenesis.', 'In the body, most cells exhibit some form of spatial asymmetry: the compartments within the cell are not evenly distributed, thereby allowing the cells to know whether a surface is on the â€˜outsideâ€™ or the â€˜insideâ€™ of a tissue or organ. In the cells of epithelial tissues, which line most of the cavities and the organs in the body, this asymmetry is known as apical-basal polarity. Maintaining apical-basal polarity in epithelial cells is one of the main barriers that stops cancer cells from invading other tissues, which is the first step of metastasis, the process through which cancer cells leave their tissue of our origin and spread to distant locations in the body.', 'In the fruit fly ', ', scientists have engineered cells in several tissues to stop producing the proteins that help establish apical-basal polarity, in an effort to study the earliest steps of tumor formation. Unfortunately, these experiments frequently lead to rampant metastasis, making it difficult to identify the earliest changes that make the tumor cells more likely to become invasive. Therefore, finding a tissue in which loss of apical-basal polarity does not cause aggressive cancer progression is necessary to address this gap in knowledge.', 'The epithelial cell layer lining the ovaries of fruit flies may be such a tissue. When these cells lose their apical-basal polarity, rather than becoming metastatic and spreading to distant organs, they interleave with each other, forming a tumorous growth that only invades into the neighboring compartment. Chatterjee et al. used this system to study individual invasive cells. They wanted to know whether the genes that these cells switch on and off are known to be involved in human cancers, and if so, which of them control the invasive behavior of tumor cells.', 'Chatterjee et al. determined that when cells in the fruit-fly ovary lost their polarity, they turned genes on and off in a pattern similar to that seen both in mammalian cancers and in tumors from other fly tissues. One of the notable changes they observed in the ovarian cells that lost apical-basal polarity was the activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 oxidative-stress signaling pathway, which normally protects cells from damage caused by excessive oxidation. In the ovarian cells, however, the activation of these genes also led to aggressive invasion of the collective tumor cells into the neighboring compartment.', 'Interestingly, this increase in invasiveness was characterized by polarized changes within the cells, specifically in the scaffolding that allows cells to keep their shape and move: the edge of the cells leading the invasion had greater levels of a protein called actin, which enables the cells to protrude into the neighboring compartments.', 'Chatterjee et al. have identified a new mechanism that impacts the migratory behavior of cells.

In the cortex, these fast-spiking cells provide feedforward and feedback synaptic inhibition onto a diverse set of cell types, including pyramidal cells, other inhibitory interneurons, and themselves. Cortical inhibitory networks broadly, and cortical parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (cPVins) specifically, are crucial for regulating sensory plasticity during both development and adulthood. Here we review the functional properties of cPVins that enable plasticity in the cortex of adult mammals and the influence of cPVins on sensory activity at four spatiotemporal scales. First, cPVins regulate developmental critical periods and adult plasticity through molecular and structural interactions with the extracellular matrix. Second, they activate in precise sequence following feedforward excitation to enforce strict temporal limits in response to the presentation of sensory stimuli. Third, they implement gain control to normalize sensory inputs and compress the dynamic range of output. Fourth, they synchronize broad network activity patterns in response to behavioral events and state changes. Much of the evidence for the contribution of cPVins to plasticity comes from classic models that rely on sensory deprivation methods to probe experience-dependent changes in the brain. We support investigating naturally occurring, adaptive cortical plasticity to study cPVin circuits in an ethologically relevant framework, and discuss recent insights from our work on maternal experience-induced auditory cortical plasticity.']",[],[]

Many, if not all these systems, become altered throughout the course of cancer initiation, growth, metastatic spread, treatment, and recurrence. Recent work has demonstrated how changes in sleep influence the development of chronic diseases, including cancer, in both humans and animal models. A common finding is that for some cancers (e.g., breast), chronic disruption of sleep/wake states prior to disease onset is associated with an increased risk for cancer development. Additionally, sleep disruption after cancer initiation is often associated with worse outcomes. Recently, evidence suggesting that cancer itself can affect neuronal circuits controlling sleep and wakefulness has accumulated. Patients with cancer often report difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and severe fatigue, during and even years after treatment. In addition to the psychological stress associated with cancer, cancer itself may alter sleep homeostasis through changes to host physiology and ', ' currently undefined mechanisms. Moreover, cancer treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal, and surgical) may further worsen sleep problems through complex biological processes yet to be fully understood.

Here, using an ', ' minigene, we generated a complete pentamer-sequence library that comprises all possible combinations of 5 nucleotides in intron 7, at a fixed site downstream of the 5â€_ splice site. We systematically analyzed the effects of all 1023 mutant pentamers on exon 7 splicing, in comparison to the wild-type minigene, in HEK293 cells. Our data show that the majority of pentamers significantly affect exon 7 splicing: 584 of them are stimulatory and 230 are inhibitory. To identify actual SREs, we utilized a motif set enrichment analysis (MSEA), from which we identified groups of stimulatory and inhibitory SRE motifs. We experimentally validated several strong SREs in ', '/', ' and other minigene settings. Our results provide a valuable resource for understanding how short RNA sequences regulate splicing. Many novel SREs can be explored further to elucidate their mechanism of action.']",['All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article and its supplementary information.'],[]

However, accurate error-free measurement of microsatellite lengths is difficult with current methods precisely because of this high error rate during amplification. We have solved this problem by using partial mutagenesis to disrupt enough of the repeat structure of initial templates so that their sequence lengths replicate faithfully.

Most of these IDPs/IDRs lack useful functional annotation limiting our understanding of their importance for organism fitness. Here we characterized IDRs using protein sequence annotations of functional sites and regions available in the UniProt knowledgebase (â€œUniProt featuresâ€ù: active site, ligand-binding pocket, regions mediating protein-protein interactions, etc.). By measuring the statistical enrichment of twenty-five UniProt features in 981 IDRs of 561 human proteins, we identified eight features that are commonly located in IDRs. We then collected the genetic variant data from the general population and patient-based databases and evaluated the prevalence of population and pathogenic variations in IDPs/IDRs. We observed that some IDRs tolerate 2 to 12-times more single amino acid-substituting missense mutations than synonymous changes in the general population. However, we also found that 37% of all germline pathogenic mutations are located in disordered regions of 96 proteins. Based on the observed-to-expected frequency of mutations, we categorized 34 IDRs in 20 proteins (DDX3X, KIT, RB1, etc.) as intolerant to mutation. Finally, using statistical analysis and a machine learning approach, we demonstrate that mutation-intolerant IDRs carry a distinct signature of functional features. Our study presents a novel approach to assign functional importance to IDRs by leveraging the wealth of available genetic data, which will aid in a deeper understating of the role of IDRs in biological processes and disease mechanisms.', 'Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in proteins are typically not considered to be functionally as important as the structured parts. However, it is becoming evident that both structured and disordered regions are essential for the repertoire of protein functions. Nevertheless, most of these largely flexible and functionally dynamic protein regions remain uncharacterized. Here, informed by human genetic diversity (i.e., genetic variations from the general population and patients), we identified the IDRs that are more frequently mutated in patients than in relatively healthy individuals, and further show that they carry a set of characteristic functional features. This approach provides a different and effective means to identify unannotated disordered protein segments that are biologically important and lead to pathogenesis upon mutation.']",[],[]

Innovative computational methods are needed to analyze these neuronal traces.

The larger this metric is and the more complex the local 3D loops and turns of the curve are. Available through the GeNePy3D open-source Python quantitative geometry library (', '), this approach termed nAdder offers new means of describing and comparing axonal and dendritic arbors. We validate this metric on simulated and real traces. By reanalysing a published zebrafish larva whole brain dataset, we show its ability to characterize different population of commissural axons, distinguish afferent connections to a target region and differentiate portions of axons and dendrites according to their behavior, shedding new light on the stereotypical nature of neuritesâ€™ local geometry.', 'To study how brain circuits are formed and function, one can extract neuron traces, i.e. the precise path that neuron arbors take in the brain to connect to other neurons. New techniques enable to do so with increasingly higher throughput, up to every single neuron with so called â€˜connectomicâ€™ approaches. Up to now, the geometry of those traces has not been a focus of study and has mainly been analysed in bulk/on average. Here, we propose to quantitatively analyse the local 3D geometry of the curves that comprise neuron arbors. We introduce an algorithm that determines whether a locally-defined curve is best fit to a line, a plane or a 3D structure. We use it to compute a single number at each point of the trace, termed local 3D scale, that measures the characteristic size of the local 3D structure: the larger this local 3D scale metric, the more the neuronâ€™s curve meanders in 3D locally. We reanalyse published neuronal traces to demonstrate that our local geometry approach enables to better characterize a neuronâ€™s morphology, with direct relevance to understanding its development and function. The local 3D scale metric will be useful in all neuroscience research that works with neuronal traces, bringing a new, geometric layer of information.']",[],[]

HIF1Î± suppresses oxidative phosphorylation and stimulates glycolysis (the Warburg effect) in most of the tumor, except for one cancer subpopulation, which was capable of using both metabolic modalities. Hence, adopting a hybrid metabolic state may allow tumor cells to survive under aerobic or hypoxic conditions, a vulnerability that may be exploited for therapeutic targeting by either metabolic or redox-based strategies.', 'In search of redox mechanisms in breast cancer, we uncovered a striking role for glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPx2) in oncogenic signaling and patient survival.

Our results illuminate the structural and mechanistic basis of Ïƒ-dependent transcriptional pausing.', 'In Ïƒ-dependent transcriptional pausing, the transcription initiation factor Ïƒ, translocating with RNA polymerase (RNAP), makes sequence-specific proteinâ€“DNA interactions with a promoter-like sequence element in the transcribed region, inducing pausing.

Understanding this mapping is often challenging because of interactions between mutations, where the result of combining several different mutations can be very different than the sum of their individual effects. Here we provide a statistical framework for modeling complex genetic interactions of this type. The key idea is to ask how fast the effects of mutations change when introducing the same mutation in increasingly distant genetic backgrounds. We then propose a model for phenotypic prediction that takes into account this tendency for the effects of mutations to be more similar in nearby genetic backgrounds.', 'Contemporary high-throughput mutagenesis experiments are providing an increasingly detailed view of the complex patterns of genetic interaction that occur between multiple mutations within a single protein or regulatory element. By simultaneously measuring the effects of thousands of combinations of mutations, these experiments have revealed that the genotypeâ€“phenotype relationship typically reflects not only genetic interactions between pairs of sites but also higher-order interactions among larger numbers of sites. However, modeling and understanding these higher-order interactions remains challenging. Here we present a method for reconstructing sequence-to-function mappings from partially observed data that can accommodate all orders of genetic interaction. The main idea is to make predictions for unobserved genotypes that match the type and extent of epistasis found in the observed data. This information on the type and extent of epistasis can be extracted by considering how phenotypic correlations change as a function of mutational distance, which is equivalent to estimating the fraction of phenotypic variance due to each order of genetic interaction (additive, pairwise, three-way, etc.). Using these estimated variance components, we then define an empirical Bayes prior that in expectation matches the observed pattern of epistasis and reconstruct the genotypeâ€“phenotype mapping by conducting Gaussian process regression under this prior. To demonstrate the power of this approach, we present an application to the antibody-binding domain GB1 and also provide a detailed exploration of a dataset consisting of high-throughput measurements for the splicing efficiency of human pre-mRNA ', ' splice sites, for which we also validate our model predictions via additional low-throughput experiments.']","['A Python command-line interface, vcregression, that implements the empirical variance component regression method described here has been deposited in GitHub (https://github.com/davidmccandlish/vcregression) (87), together with the other scripts necessary to replicate the results presented here.

Traditional feedback control algorithms spend significant resources to constantly sense and stabilize a continuous control variable of interest, such as vehicle speed for implementing cruise control, or body temperature for maintaining homeostasis. By contrast, discrete-event feedback (e.g. a server acknowledging when data are successfully transmitted, or a brief antennal interaction when an ant returns to the nest after successful foraging) can reduce costs associated with monitoring a continuous variable; however, optimizing behaviour in this setting requires alternative strategies. Here, we studied parallels between discrete-event feedback control strategies in biological and engineered systems. We found that two common engineering rulesâ€”additive-increase, upon positive feedback, and multiplicative-decrease, upon negative feedback, and multiplicative-increase multiplicative-decreaseâ€”are used by diverse biological systems, including for regulating foraging by harvester ant colonies, for maintaining cell-size homeostasis, and for synaptic learning and adaptation in neural circuits. These rules support several goals of these systems, including optimizing efficiency (i.e. using all available resources); splitting resources fairly among cooperating agents, or conversely, acquiring resources quickly among competing agents; and minimizing the latency of responses, especially when conditions change. We hypothesize that theoretical frameworks from distributed computing may offer new ways to analyse adaptation behaviour of biology systems, and in return, biological strategies may inspire new algorithms for discrete-event feedback control in engineering.']",['This article has no additional data.'],[]
